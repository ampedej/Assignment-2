    <h2>Project 2</h2>

<p>My theme is based on the upcoming fantasy football season. I have always been a huge football junky and fantasy football just adds to the excitement of games. Especially in a game that does not interest you.</p>
<p>My story this week is kind of boring. I am not that good at telling stories. I think it's pretty straight forward and easy to understand. </p>
<p>I was unable to figure out how to include the return into the Array. I've worked on it for hours but just can't seem to get it to work correctly. It's something i need to practice more. I was able to include the returns on all other functions however.</p>
